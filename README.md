# TODO
TLDR slightly opinionated way I'll be making games with Raylib.

# Current features include
- Particle system (C# port of [libpartikel](https://github.com/dbriemann/libpartikel))
- Scene Base class that works by changing current scene
- Game class a singleton so you can do lots of game related stuff (this needs to be explained better plus with examples)


# To do
- Add Singleton audio manager responsible for all things audio.
- Possibly port tweening library for a pseudo animation system
- Include GUM into this (find a way to allow you to always get only the necessary GUM related raylib libraries)
- Possible save system or scene management/asset management system.
- Examples, examples and examples
